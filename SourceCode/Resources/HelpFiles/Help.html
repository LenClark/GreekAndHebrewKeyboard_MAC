<h1>The Purpose of Keyboard</h1>
I often need to include Greek or Hebrew words or phrases in normal, English documents and it's often a pain to do so.  This can be done for free and relatively simply by installing additional keyboards .  However, that's a little fiddly to set up and I find that the various keyboards sometimes spontaneously set themselves to one of the other languages.  It's also somewhat distracting to keep changing from English to Greek or Hebrew and back again.

So, I decided to create a simple way of adding Greek and Hebrew that I can embed in my documents.  (Note: my base language is English but - apart from this help file - it should work fine with any other language ... but it has only been tested with English.  In particular, I don't know how well it will work with other right-to-left languages or with variants of Chinese, Korean, etc.)
<h1>An Introduction to the Application</h1>

<p>I think it is reasonably self-explanatory, but here's a brief overview.
  
  When the program starts it will always take you to the Hebrew keyboard:  </p>
<p align="center"><img src="001_Initial_View.jpg" alt="Initial view of the application" width="1079" height="608" /></p>
<p>Clicking on any of the main hebrew characters using your mouse will add them to the text box at the top of the window.  The various vowels and key symbols ar found on the top row of keys (and the mappaq next the to Pe key): clicking these will add the relevant vowel or symbol to the preceding character.  (By "preceding" I mean the character to the <em>right</em> of the hair-line cursor.)  Note that the two keys next to the Clear key(<span class="style2">&#64300;</span> and <span class="style2">&#64299;</span>):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="001bKeys.jpeg" alt="Initial view of the application" width="205" height="55" /></p>
<p>are <em>not</em> the complete shin or sin character but the shin dot and the sin dot.  You will need to tap the shin/sin key below and then one of these two keys to create the full character.
  
  <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have not made any attempt to prevent unrealistic or illegal use of vowels or symbols, so it is down to you to add only those elements that are allowed by Hebrew rules.
  
  The only non-Hebrew keys that currently function are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backspace</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
  <li>Enter</li>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Left</li>
  <li>Right</li>
  <li>End</li>
  <li>Gk</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking either one of the <strong>Shift</strong> keys or the <strong>Caps</strong> key will take you to an alternative Hebrew keyboard which is, effectively, dedicated to accents, points and Yiddish characters:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="001c_Shifted_View.JPG" alt="Hebrew Accents" width="1079" height="608" /> </p>
<p>The difference between these two keys is, as you would expect: pressing <strong>Shift</strong> will revert to the main keyboard, once you have clicked on an accent or other key; <strong>Ctrl</strong>, on the other hand, will remain in the shifted keyboard.</p>
<p>The <strong>Gk</strong> key will take you to the Greek keyboard:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="002_Greek_Keyboard.JPG" alt="Greek Keyboard" width="1079" height="608" /> </p>
<p>As with the Hebrew keyboard, pressing <strong>Shift</strong> or <strong>Ctrl</strong> will take you to an alternative Greek keyboard but, this time, it provides the expected upper-case characters:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="002b_Shifted_View.JPG" alt="Greek Shifted Keyboard" width="1079" height="608" /> </p>
<h1>Using your physical keyboard</h1>
<p>You may prefer to use your non-Greek/non-Hebrew physical keyboard. If so, you can do this.</p>
<h3>Hebrew Characters using your Keyboard </h3>
<p>First of all, click on the <strong>Use the Physical Keyboard</strong> button, placed to the right of the keyboard. Assuming that you are currently using the Hebrew keyboard, you will subsequently see the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="003_Hebrew_Physical_Input.JPG" alt="Physical Input - Hebrew" width="1079" height="608" /></p>
<p>This may look a little complex at first but you will soon get used to it. The top table tells you which physical keys are translated as Hebrew characters. For example, typing &quot;m&quot; will enter the normal Hebrew character, Mem (<span class="style2">&#1502;</span>). Note that all characters that have a different terminal form can be entered as either lower case characters (for the non-terminal form) or upper case, for the terminal form. For example, typing &quot;M&quot; will enter the terminal Mem (<span class="style2">&#1501;</span>). In other cases, where we have two consonants with varying but similar pronunciation (such as he - &#1492; - and heth - &#1495;), the same English character will be used but one will be lower case and the other upper case. </p>
<p>The transliteration does <em>not</em> follow any standard protocol and the rationale for specific characters is as follows:</p>

<p>Vowels follow a similar rationale where I have tried to use lower case for short vowels and upper case for long vowels (where they are not represented by consonants). Note that the qamats is also used for the short o (although the qamats qatan <em>is</em> provided, as we will describe below).</p>
<p>The bottom table (of the keyboard app, as seen in the image above) shows how you can add less used symbols - mainly accents. These are less intuitive and less easy to memorise. The first ten characters are found simply by using the numbers 0 to 9. The rest are a combination of the Ctrl key and a number or letter. There is no real rational in which physical key gives which character: they are simply in Unicode sequence.</p>
<p>In all cases, if you hover over   the Hebrew character, a small prompt will appear to tell you what it is. This is because some symbols are very small and difficult to see clearly. </p>
<p>Note, in addition, that the arrow keys have been replaced by the four keyboard arrow keys.  If used on their own, they will move you one character or line in the indicated direction.  If you hold down the <strong>Fn</strong> key will tapping them, they will take you to the extreme in that direction.</p>
<h3>Greek Characters using your Keyboard</h3>
<p>When you cange to use the physical keyboard, a pair of radio buttons will also appear beneath the selection button. These will allow you to change to and from Hebrew and Greek keys. Clicking on <strong>Greek</strong> will present you with new information and change the way the program responds to your key presses:</p>

<p>In general, this should be more straightforward than Hebrew. Lower and upper case functions much as in English. So, &quot;e&quot; gives &epsilon; and &quot;E&quot; gives &Epsilon;. There are a few characters that vary from English and, in these cases, they are formed by holding down the Ctrl key while tapping the obvious key, as follows:</p>
<table width="900" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="256">Ctrl + ... </td>
    <td width="224">...</td>
    <td width="182">Ctrl + Shift + ... </td>
    <td width="210">...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>e</td>
    <td>&eta;</td>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>&Eta;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t</td>
    <td>&theta;</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>&Theta;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>s</td>
    <td>&sigmaf;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>p</td>
    <td>&psi;</td>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td>&Psi;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>o</td>
    <td>&omega;</td>
    <td>O</td>
    <td>&Omega;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that we have also supplied w (=  &#989;) and W (= &#988;).</p>
<p>You can revert to the mouse-based keyboard at any time by clicking on the <strong>Use the Virtual Keyboard</strong> button. </p>
<h1>What do I do with it?</h1>
<p>When you have typed in your Greek or Hebrew content, simply:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the Copy button (to the right of the text box);</li>
  <li>Switch to your word processor (or whatever you are using);</li>
  <li>Make sure you have set your cursor to the position in the document where you want to add your Greek or Hebrew;</li>
  <li>Paste the text into your work.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can paste the text either by holding down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> (Control) key on your keyboard while you press the <strong>V</strong> key, or by right clicking with the mouse where you want to place the Greek or Hebrew and selecting <strong>Paste</strong> from the pop-up menu.</p>
<h1>Some Simple Preferences</h1>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> menu option on the application's main menu, and then <strong>Preferences ...</strong> will display an additional dialog:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="005_Preferences.jpg" alt="Physical Keyboard - Greek" width="526" height="403" />   </p>
<p>The first section will allow you to configure whether the application starts in the Hebrew or Greek keyboard.  The second will determine the size of font in the <strong>Entered Text</strong> edit box from startup.  You can experiment with other menu options to discover their effect on the text you have typed.</p>
<h1>Feedback</h1>
